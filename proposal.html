      <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
For many creatives and developers, a common difficulty arises when it comes to connecting and finding collaborators. Many times, individuals struggle to find projects that allow them to gain experience, whether they are just starting or working on a passion project. There is often a barrier that is created when it comes to connecting and finding individuals to collaborate with, especially in such a hypercompetitive market. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Platforms such as 
        <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> 
        and 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a> 
have provided methods for individuals to connect and collaborate. Oftentimes, though, they do not provide a streamlined approach in order to make the process effective. LinkedIn is almost always full of individuals needing to constantly reach out, and sometimes not even being able to connect to work on a project. GitHub, on the other hand, makes it difficult for users to be able to connect, due to how it primarily focuses on the project collaboration aspect instead of the process that goes into creating one. 
      </p>
       <p>
Our project aims to solve this issue by creating a platform that allows users to showcase their ideas and existing projects. Aiming to put an emphasis on the work and gain experience. Users will be able to search for projects to be a part of, or create their own projects where they can find users in order to help.

      <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
      <p>
 Our target audience for this platform includes developers and other creatives who struggle to showcase their hands-on experience in an increasingly competitive space. Through this platform, users can browse ongoing projects, request to join development teams, highlight their skills and interests, receive feedback from other professionals, and be invited to collaborate based on their previous experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      More than just a networking tool, this platform empowers users to break free from the barriers of a hypercompetitive industry. Reviving the creativity, collaboration, and sense of community that coding and hands-on experience once inspired. It will do this by allowing users to: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browse ongoing projects by category, tech stack, or skill level.</li>
        <li>Request to join project teams or start new projects with open roles.</li>
        <li>Showcase their skills, past work, and interests on personalized profiles.</li>
        <li>Receive feedback and endorsements from team members or mentors.</li>
        <li>Get matched to projects through a recommendation system that considers previous experience and stated interests.</li>
      </ul>
